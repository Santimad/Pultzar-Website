This is the README File for Pultzar Website.

The aim of this project is to make a complete web page using HTML code to create index file, then include boostrap CSS library to it and some javascript code for extra funcionalities. I would like to improve a nice good-looking view with a great performance to run in any server with no more than 20mb of disk space available.

Features to be included:
-Cross plataform
-Responsive
-Dynamic content.
-Forms.
